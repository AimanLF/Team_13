# Wright-Fisher Simulation
Aim is to simulate the evolution of a genetic population over time. A population is composed of individuals, each one has a genome. At each generation a new population of the same size is randomly chosen among individuals of the last population. Using the multinomial distribution we define new frequencies for each alleles (e.g. different genotypes) allowing the population to evolve.

## Run the program
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes:   
git clone https://github.com/EPFL-SV-cpp-projects/Team_13.git   
cd Team_13  
rm -rf build   
mkdir build 
cd build   
cmake ..  
make   
make doc   

## Output

```
tbd
```

## Understand the tests
To execute the tests, type the command:
make test
### Test_multibinomial
Explain what these tests test and why
