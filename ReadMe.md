# Wright-Fisher Simulation
Aim is to simulate the evolution of a genetic population over time. A population is composed of individuals, each one has a genome. At each generation a new population of the same size is randomly chosen among individuals of the last population. Using the multinomial distribution we define new frequencies for each alleles (e.g. different genotypes) allowing the population to evolve.

## Run the program
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes: 
git clone https://github.com/EPFL-SV-cpp-projects/Team_13.git 
cd Team_X 
rm -rf build 
mkdir build cd build 
cmake ../ 
make 
make doc 
make test 
cd ../../
